 <h1><span>Top Ten HTML tags You Need To Build a Website</span></h1>

<h3> 1. Paragraph: &lt;p&gt</h3>
    <p>The paragraph tag instructs the code editor that the content you are writing in between the tags is long form. Such as this here. </p>
<h3>2. Heading: &lt;h1-h6&gt</h3> 
    <p>There are six Heading tags that you can use: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. Headings are used for titles. &lt;h1&gt is the biggest in size. Usually there is only one h1 used in a document. But that's your decision to make. Please keep in mind that you cannot or should not use an &lt;h2&gt or any other lower heading until you use an &lt;h1&gt. </p>
<h3>3. Images: &lt;img&gt</h3>
    <p>Images are important pieces of content for any website. Images are used to help the user get a visual understanding of what the website is about. This is the theory behind it. Adding images can be tricky because not only do you need to use the &lt;img&gt tag but you need to include the path the computer needs to take to retrieve the image. Usually this is commanded via the <em>src</em>.Once you add the path, the image should appear on your website. Keep in mind that if your images are moved from their location, then you must update the root path. </p>
<h3>4. Links: &lt;a&gt</h3>
    <p>A website would not be a website without links, I'm just saying. The World Wide Web would not be magical if websites were static. Links are like clues to treasure maps of information. That information helps users find the solution to the problem they have. Adding links to a site is done using the anchor tag: &lt;a&gt. Similar to &lt;img&gt tag, the anchor tag needs to include a path to either an internal or external destination. The directions come with the assistance of a <em>href</em>, which stands for <b>hyperlink reference</b>. The <em>href</em>provides the <b>URL</b>of the link, which then directs the broweser were to send the user. </p>
    <h3>5. Section: &lt;section&gt</h3>
    <p>The &lt;section&gt tag helps seperate a websites sections. Depending on the website, many websites have a lot of information. Sections bring clarity and organization to the chaos. You can think about &lt;section&gt tag like chapters in a book. This is helpful for both <a href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo">Search Engine Optimization</a>(SEO) strategy and for styling purposes. </p>
 <h3>6. Div: &lt;div&gt</h3>
    <p>Unlike the &lt;section&gt tag, that seperates diffenet content from one another, the &lt;div&gt</p>unites. The &lt;div&gt is the ultimate uniter for content. This tag helps bring content together into smaller blocks of information. Like &lt;section&gt, the &lt;div&gt can be seen as sub-chapters. Using this tag may not be <em>sexy</em> but its wicked awesome when you are trying to style your website. Another positive factor is that it helps to let the <a href="https://totally.digital/quick-guides/search-engine-basics-crawling-indexing-ranking/">search engine crawlers</a>index the information.
<h3>7. Navigation: &lt;nav&gt</h3>
    <p>Building a website is more than just building a website for the sake of building it. There has to be a reason. In other words, there is an intention. What is the reason? Most of the time people are online to find a solution to a problem. Some need inforamtion. Others may need to make a purchase. The point is that people are in need of something. When a user lands on a page they want to know where they can find what is that they are looking for. Usually in the <b>Navigation</b> you will find a menu. In that menu you will find options to navigate to internal links.  </p>
<h3>8. List: &lt:ul&gt and &lt;ol&gt and &lt;li&gt</h3>
    <p>Lists tags are very useful. Lists tags come in three's. What do I mean by that? In order to utilize the list tags you need to decide if the information you want to shere needs to be in order or it does not. If order is important that you would use an &lt;ol&gt. If items on a list is not important than the &lt;ul&gt tag is used.</p>
    <p>The third list tag is the actual &lt;li&gt tag. This is used when you list down your items regaedless of order. Each item on your list should inclide a &lt;li&gt.</p>
<h3>9. Body &lt;body&gt</h3>
    <p>The &lt;body&gt tag is used once in the <b>HTML</b>document. This tag is important becasue this is where your entire content is placed. So, yes. The &lt;body&gt is important. </p>
<h3>10. DOCTYPE!</h3>
<p>Before any code is typed, you need to first let the code editor know that the document you are about to create will be an <b>HTML</b> document. The DOCTYPE! declaration is the first command in any HTML document. The format is called a <em>boilerplate</em>which is the a formal way of setting up your text editor to recognize that the the content you will be working in is HTML compatible. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
